### Notes
> Since version `4.1.4` the rules for passing parameters through push router have changed. 
At the moment, there is no understanding of how to transfer data without saving it after page reload.

‚ùó**WARNING:** Upgrading `vue-router` to a version higher than `4.1.3` will break the functionality of the useBackButton hook.
